              <h1 className="subheader">Microsoft Excel and VBA</h1> 
              <p> During my time at Schneider Electric as a Data Analyst/IT Intern, I had the chance to teach myself Visual Basics for Applications (VBA), a programming language that can easily interact with Microsoft products such as Excel, Access, or Outlook </p>
              <br/>
              <p> While I did create many "normal" macros to automate more conventional tasks such as processing data or sending emails, I also had the opportunity to create a few simple games in VBA</p>
              <br/>
              <p> One of the tasks assigned to me was to "gamify" the learning experience for some training data. To accomplish this goal, I created educational games which could be played by anyone with Microsoft Excel</p>
              <p> Some examples of this can be seen and downloaded on the right.</p>
      
              <br/>

                    <h1 className="subheader">Snake</h1>
                    <p>One of the first non-trivial macros I created. In this modified snake game, players are asked a question and need to guide the snake to the correct answer </p>
                    <p>Questions can be easily customizable without any programming language, and can be both simple text or pictures.</p>

                       However, as the tasks performed by these macros were used to process confidential data, they are not available for download</p>
